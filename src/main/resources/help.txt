ZipDiff V1.0 -- by Nicolas de Jong, 2020-02-26
Tool for listing, storing and resolving differences between zip files:

- Compare two zip files and list the differences.
- Generate a '.zpatch' file containing the differences between two zip files.
- Generate a new zip file from an original zip file and a '.zpatch' file.

Files are compared by using the paths and CRC values in the zip.

Command line options:
-f, --base-file <name>      Base zip file
-c, --compare-with <name>   Zip file to compare with
-g, --generate-patch <name> Generates patch file instead of listing the differences
-p, --patch-with <name>     File (.zpatch) to patch given -file with
-t, --patch-to <name>       File holding the patch result (opposite of --generate-patch)
-i, --ignore-validation     Skips testing patch result (crc check)
-v, --verbose               Shows a bit more info

Examples:
Compare two zip files and list the differences:
  --base-file old.zip --compare-with new.zip

Compare two zip files and generate a patch file containing the differences:
  --base-file old.zip --compare-with new.zip --generate-patch oldToNew

Patch an existing zip file to a new zip file:
  --base-file old.zip --patch-with oldToNew.zpatch --patch-to new.zip
